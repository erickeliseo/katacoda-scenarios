### Ceph Storage Quickstart

First we need to wait for Kubernetes and Rook to be ready. Be patient, this is not a very high performance environment, just a place to learn something :-

### Step: Wait for Kubernetes to be ready

Click the below section which waits for all Kubernetes nodes to be ready.
```
watch kubectl get nodes
```{{execute T1}}

When all nodes (master, node01) show status Running then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

### Step: Clone the Git Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/rook/rook.git
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Deploy the Rook Operator

The first step is to deploy the Rook system components, which include the Rook agent running on each node in your cluster as well as Rook operator pod.

```
kubectl create -f rook/cluster/examples/kubernetes/ceph/operator.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

verify the rook-ceph-operator, rook-ceph-agent, and rook-discover pods are in the `Running` state before proceeding

```
watch kubectl -n rook-ceph-system get pod
```{{execute T1}}

When all pods show status Running then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.









Now that we have the Portworx cluster up, let's proceed to the next step !
