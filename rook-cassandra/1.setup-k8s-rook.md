First we need to wait for Kubernetes and Rook to be ready. Be patient, this is not a very high performance environment, just a place to learn something :-

### Step: Wait for Kubernetes to be ready

Click the below section which waits for all Kubernetes nodes to be ready.
```
watch kubectl get nodes
```{{execute T1}}

When all nodes (master, node01) show status Running then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

verify the rook-ceph-operator, rook-ceph-agent, and rook-discover pods are in the `Running` state before proceeding
```
watch kubectl -n rook-ceph-system get pod
```{{execute T1}}

When all pods show status Running then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

Use kubectl to list pods in the rook namespace. You should be able to see the following pods rook-ceph-mgr*, rook-ceph-mon*, rook-ceph-osd* once they are all running. The number of osd pods will depend on the number of nodes in the cluster and the number of devices and directories configured.

```
watch kubectl -n rook-ceph get pod
```{{execute T1}}

When all pods show status Running then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

Now that we have the Rook cluster up, let's proceed to the next step !
