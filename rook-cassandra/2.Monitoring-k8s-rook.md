Click the below section which waits for all Kubernetes nodes to be ready.
```
watch kubectl get nodes
```{{execute T1}}

When all nodes (master, node01) show status Running then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

### Step: Clone the Git Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/rook/rook.git
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Deploy the Rook Operator

The first step is to deploy the Rook system components, which include the Rook agent running on each node in your cluster as well as Rook operator pod.

```
kubectl create -f rook/cluster/examples/kubernetes/ceph/operator.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

verify the rook-ceph-operator, rook-ceph-agent, and rook-discover pods are in the `Running` state before proceeding

```
watch kubectl -n rook-ceph-system get pod
```{{execute T1}}

When all pods show status Running then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.


### Step: Create a Rook Cluster
Now that the Rook operator, agent, and discover pods are running, we can create the Rook cluster.

```
kubectl create -f rook/cluster/examples/kubernetes/ceph/cluster.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Use kubectl to list pods in the rook namespace. You should be able to see the following pods once they are all running. The number of osd pods will depend on the number of nodes in the cluster and the number of devices and directories configured.

```
watch kubectl -n rook-ceph get pod
```{{execute T1}}

When all pods show status Running then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

Now that we have the Rook cluster up, let's proceed to the next step !
