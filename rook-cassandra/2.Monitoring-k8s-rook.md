### Ceph Dashboard
The dashboard is a very helpful tool to give you an overview of the status of your cluster, including overall health, status of the mon quorum, status of the mgr, osd, and other Ceph daemons, view pools and PG status, show logs for the daemons, and more. Rook makes it simple to enable the dashboard.

Commonly you will want to view the dashboard from outside the cluster. There are several ways to expose a service that will depend on the environment you are running in. You can use an Ingress Controller or other methods for exposing services such as NodePort, LoadBalancer, or ExternalIPs.

The simplest way to expose the service is using the NodePort to open a port on the VM that can be accessed by the host. To create a service with the NodePort:




```
export URL=https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-30900-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/
```{{execute T1}}






Verificando servidor Apache-03 (Puerto: 8003): https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8003-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/



```
kubectl create -f files/dashboard-external-NodePort.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Viewing the Dashboard: https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-30700-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

### Prometheus Operator + Grafana Dashboards

Install Prometheus Operator:
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.15/bundle.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

















Click the below section which waits for all Kubernetes nodes to be ready.
```
watch kubectl get nodes
```{{execute T1}}

When all nodes (master, node01) show status Running then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

### Step: Clone the Git Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/rook/rook.git
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Deploy the Rook Operator

The first step is to deploy the Rook system components, which include the Rook agent running on each node in your cluster as well as Rook operator pod.

```
kubectl create -f rook/cluster/examples/kubernetes/ceph/operator.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

verify the rook-ceph-operator, rook-ceph-agent, and rook-discover pods are in the `Running` state before proceeding

```
watch kubectl -n rook-ceph-system get pod
```{{execute T1}}

When all pods show status Running then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.


### Step: Create a Rook Cluster
Now that the Rook operator, agent, and discover pods are running, we can create the Rook cluster.

```
kubectl create -f rook/cluster/examples/kubernetes/ceph/cluster.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

Use kubectl to list pods in the rook namespace. You should be able to see the following pods once they are all running. The number of osd pods will depend on the number of nodes in the cluster and the number of devices and directories configured.

```
watch kubectl -n rook-ceph get pod
```{{execute T1}}

When all pods show status Running then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

### Monitoring





Now that we have the Rook cluster up, let's proceed to the next step !
